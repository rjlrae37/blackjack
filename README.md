# Blackjack
Play blackjack against your computer! The Card.cpp and blackjack.h files can be used as base for any card game, since they contain all the mechanisms to create, shuffle and print packs and cards. This project uses the C++ standard library and the Visual Studio precompiled headers. The inspiration for this project was found over here: http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/6-x-chapter-6-comprehensive-quiz/
